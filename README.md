# HTLM-To-WordCloud
This program scrapes text off of any HTML webpage or local file, processes the content, and generates a wordcloud over a mask of an existing image.


A big thanks to the developers of the external Python libraries used: NLTK, PIL, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, WordCloud

The example in the repository is of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment generated over a mask image of a hatchet.
Thanks to Project Gutenberg for hosting the novel.
